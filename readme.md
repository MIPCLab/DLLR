This repository provides an implementation of the label reassignment module from the paper:

> W. Han, W. Jiang, J. Geng, and W. Miao, "Difference-Complementary Learning and Label Reassignment for Multimodal Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images," IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 34, pp. 566–580, 2025.

In multimodal remote sensing, optical and SAR images offer complementary information but suffer from significant differences in imaging mechanisms, strong noise, and scarce pixel-wise annotations. The proposed DLLR framework addresses these challenges by combining difference-complementary learning with a multi-level label reassignment strategy to improve pseudo-label quality for semi-supervised multimodal semantic segmentation.

In this repository, we will **gradually release the code for the label reassignment part**, where the pseudo-label assignment for unlabeled pixels is formulated as an optimal transport optimization problem. This module can be plugged into existing multimodal semi-supervised segmentation pipelines to enhance pseudo-label reliability under limited labeled data and complex regions (e.g., blurred edges and class-confusing areas).
